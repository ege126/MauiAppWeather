It is a Windows application with the following components:
* A database for registering and logging in-the database will be initialized on the computer which runs the app for now
* A page which sends an automatic e-mail for resetting the password-for now it will reset the password, because the password is not stored on cloud
* A weather forecast page, which displays the forecast of where the device is. Forecast consists of three parts: current weather, forecast of the following 8 hours and the forecast of the following 3 days
